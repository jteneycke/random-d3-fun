random-d3-fun
=============

Just messing around and getting a feel for d3.

Uses the [Brooklyn Museum API](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/) to sort all works by Eames (Ray or Charles) by material.

Clone the repo, navigate into the folder, run it with a python simple server
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jteneycke/random-d3-fun.git
$ cd random-d3-fun/eames-materiality
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Go to ```localhost:8000``` in your browser and soak up them bar charts!
